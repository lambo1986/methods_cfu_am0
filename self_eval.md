# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
***I am proud of being able to figure out the answers to most of these problems just be referencing my notes and reading the error messages I get from terminal or replit.***
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
***A method can perform a series of math equations or logic comparisons on a set of data, saving us a ton of time! Otherwise, we would have to organize large data sets in a slower fashion or manually. Methods can also store messages to be read by the user of the app, depending on what data they input.***
